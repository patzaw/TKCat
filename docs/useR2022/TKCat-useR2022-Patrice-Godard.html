      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      
      <p>Research organizations generate, manage, and use more and more knowledge resources which can be highly heterogenous in their origin, their scope, and their structure. Making this knowledge compliant to F.A.I.R. (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles is critical for facilitating the generation of new insights leveraging it. The aim of the TKCat (Tailored Knowledge Catalog) R package is to facilitate the management of such resources that are frequently used alone or in combination in research environments. In TKCat, knowledge resources are manipulated as modeled database (MDB) objects. These objects provide access to the data tables along with a general description of the resource and a detailed data model generated with ReDaMoR (<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReDaMoR" target="_blank">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ReDaMoR</a>) and which documents the tables, their fields, and their relationships. These MDBs are then gathered in catalogs that can be easily explored and shared. TKCat provides tools to easily subset, filter and combine MDBs and create new catalogs suited for specific needs. Currently, there are 3 different implementations of MDBs which are supported by TKCat: in R memory (memoMDB), in files (fileMDB) and in ClickHouse (<a href="https://clickhouse.com/" target="_blank">https://clickhouse.com/</a>) (chMDB). The TKCat R package is available on github (<a href="https://github.com/patzaw/TKCat" target="_blank">https://github.com/patzaw/TKCat</a>).</p>
