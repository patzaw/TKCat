The aim of TKCat (Tailored Knowledge Catalog) is to facilitate the management of
data from knowledge resources that are frequently used alone or together in
research environments. In TKCat, knowledge resources are manipulated as modeled
database (MDB) objects. These objects provide access to the data tables along
with a general description of the resource and a detail data model generated
with [ReDaMoR](https://github.com/patzaw/ReDaMoR) documenting the tables, their
fields and their relationships. These MDB are then gathered in catalogs that can
be easily explored an shared. TKCat provides tools to easily subset, filter and
combine MDBs and create new catalogs suited for specific needs.
