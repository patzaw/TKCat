The aim of TKCat is to facilitate the management of data from knowledge
resources that are frequently used alone or together in research environments.
In TKCat, knowledge resources are manipulated as modeled database (MDB)
objects. These objects provide access to the data tables along with a general
description of the resource and
a detail data model generated with [ReDaMoR](https://github.com/patzaw/ReDaMoR)
documenting the tables, their fields and their relationships.
These MDB are then gathered in catalogs that can be easily explored an shared.
TKCat provides tools to easily subset, filter and combine MDBs and
create new catalogs suited for specific needs.
