	abstract = {The understanding of molecular processes involved in a specific biological system can be significantly improved by combining and comparing different data sets and knowledge resources. However, these information sources often use different identification systems and an identifier conversion step is required before any integration effort. Mapping between identifiers is often provided by the reference information resources and several tools have been implemented to simplify their use. However, most of these tools do not combine the information provided by individual resources to increase the completeness of the mapping process. Also, deprecated identifiers from former versions of databases are not taken into account. Finally, finding automatically the most relevant path to map identifiers from one scope to the other is often not trivial. The Biological Entity Dictionary (BED) addresses these three challenges by relying on a graph data model describing possible relationships between entities and their identifiers. This model has been implemented using Neo4j and an R package provides functions to query the graph but also to create and feed a custom instance of the database. This design combined with a local installation of the graph database and a cache system make BED very efficient to convert large lists of identifiers.},

	abstract = {ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) is a freely available, public archive of human genetic variants and interpretations of their significance to disease, maintained at the National Institutes of Health. Interpretations of the clinical significance of variants are submitted by clinical testing laboratories, research laboratories, expert panels and other groups. ClinVar aggregates data by variant-disease pairs, and by variant (or set of variants). Data aggregated by variant are accessible on the website, in an improved set of variant call format files and as a new comprehensive XML report. ClinVar recently started accepting submissions that are focused primarily on providing phenotypic information for individuals who have had genetic testing. Submissions may come from clinical providers providing their own interpretation of the variant ('provider interpretation') or from groups such as patient registries that primarily provide phenotypic information from patients ('phenotyping only'). ClinVar continues to make improvements to its search and retrieval functions. Several new fields are now indexed for more precise searching, and filters allow the user to narrow down a large set of search results.},
