# Introduction

```{r child = 'supp/genIntro.Rmd'}
```

This vignette focuses on a local usage of TKCat in R console.
Two other vignettes describe more specifically how TKCat can be used with
a [ClickHouse][clickhouse] database from
a [user][chuguide] or an [operational][opman] perspectives.
A final vignette is dedicated to
an [extended documentation of collections][collections].

# Modeled databases and embeded information

A modeled database (MDB) in TKCat gathers the following information:

- General database information including a mandatory *name* and optionally
the following fields: *title*, *description*, *url*, *version* and *maintainer*.
- A data model created using the [ReDaMoR][redamor] package.
- A list of tables corresponding to reference concepts shared by different
MDBs. The way these concepts are identified is defined in specific documents
called collections.
- The data themselves organized according to the data model.

<!------------->
## Reading examples

### HPO

A subset of the [Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)][hpo]
is provided within the [ReDaMoR][redamor] package.
The HPO aims to provide a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic
abnormalities encountered in human diseases [@kohler_expansion_2019].
An MDB object based on files (see [MDB implementations](#mdb-implementations))
can be read as shown below.
As explained above, the data provided by the `path` parameter are
documented with a model (`dataModel` parameter) and general
information (`dbInfo` parameter).

```{r}
file_hpo <- read_fileMDB(
   path=system.file("examples/HPO-subset", package="ReDaMoR"),
   dataModel=system.file("examples/HPO-model.json", package="ReDaMoR"),
   dbInfo=list(
      "name"="HPO",
      "title"="Data extracted from the HPO database",
      "description"=paste(
         "This is a very small subset of the HPO!",
         "Visit the reference URL for more information."
      ),
      "url"="http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/"
   )
)
```

The message displayed in the console indicates if the data fit the data model.
It relies on the `ReDaMoR::confront_data()` functions and check by default
the first 10 rows of each file.

The data model can then be drawn.

```{r}
plot(data_model(file_hpo))
```

In this model, the *HPO_hp* table refers to the concept of phenotype
and the *HPO_disease* to the concept of disease.
These concepts are used to define the condition of individuals.
The **Condition** collection is built in the TKCat package.
Identifying the collection members in an MDB is done by providing
a table of the shape as displayed below and using
the `collection_members()` function.
As described in
the [Merging with collections](#Merging-with-collections) section,
collections identify
concepts shared by different MDB and can be used to merge resources
according to these concepts.

```{r}
cn <- c(
   "collection", "cid",                "resource", "mid", "table",        "field",     "static", "value",    "type"
)
cm <- matrix(data=c(
   "Condition",  "HPO_conditions_1.0", "HPO",      1,     "HPO_hp",       "condition",  TRUE,    "Phenotype", NA,
   "Condition",  "HPO_conditions_1.0", "HPO",      1,     "HPO_hp",       "source",     TRUE,    "HP",        NA,
   "Condition",  "HPO_conditions_1.0", "HPO",      1,     "HPO_hp",       "identifier", FALSE,   "id",        NA,
   "Condition",  "HPO_conditions_1.0", "HPO",      2,     "HPO_diseases", "condition",  TRUE,    "Disease",   NA,
   "Condition",  "HPO_conditions_1.0", "HPO",      2,     "HPO_diseases", "source",     FALSE,   "db",        NA,
   "Condition",  "HPO_conditions_1.0", "HPO",      2,     "HPO_diseases", "identifier", FALSE,   "id",        NA
   ),
   ncol=9, byrow=TRUE
) %>%
   set_colnames(cn) %>% 
   as_tibble() %>% 
   mutate(mid=as.integer(mid), static=as.logical(static))
collection_members(file_hpo) <- cm
file_hpo
```

### ClinVar

A subset of the [ClinVar][clinvar] database is provided within this package.
ClinVar is a freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships
among human variations and phenotypes,
with supporting evidence [@landrum_clinvar_2018].
This resource can be read as a `fileMDB` as shown above, excepted that all
the documenting information is included in the resource directory in this
case and it is organized as following:

- **DESCRIPTION.json** contains db_information
- **data** is a directory with all the data tables
- **model** is a directory with model information:
   - A **json** file with the ClinVar data model created with
   the [ReDaMoR][redamor] package
   - A **Collections** subfolder with one json file per collection with
   members in the ClinVar resource


```{r}
file_clinvar <- read_fileMDB(
   path=system.file("examples/ClinVar", package="TKCat")
)
```

### CHEMBL

A self-documented subset of the [CHEMBL][chembl] database is also provided
in this package.
It can be read the same way as the ClinVar resource.

```{r}
file_chembl <- read_fileMDB(
   path=system.file("examples/CHEMBL", package="TKCat")
)
```

CHEMBL is a manually curated chemical database of bioactive molecules with
drug-like properties [@mendez_chembl_2019].

<!------------->
## MDB implementations

There are 3 main implementations of MDBs:

- **fileMDB** objects keep the data in files and load them only when requested
by the user. These implementation is the first one which is used when reading
MDB as demonstrated in the examples above.

- **memoMDB** objects have all the data loaded in memory. These objects are
very easy to use but can take time to load and can use a lot of memory.

- **chMDB** objects get the data from a ClickHouse database providing a
catalog of MDBs as described in the [chTKCat](#chTKCat) section below.
More information about chTKCat and chMDB objects can also be found in
the [chTKCat user guide][chuguide] and the [chTKCat operational manual][opman].

The different implementations can be converted to each others using
`as_fileMDB()`, `as_memoMDB()` and `as_chMDB()` functions.

```{r}
memo_clinvar <- as_memoMDB(file_clinvar)
object.size(file_clinvar) %>% print(units="Kb")
object.size(memo_clinvar) %>% print(units="Kb")
```


A fourth implementation is **metaMDB** which combines several MDBs glued
together with relational tables
(see the [Merging with collections](#Merging-with-collections) section).

Most of the functions described below work with any MDB implementation.
A few functions are specific to each implementation.

<!------------->
## Getting information

### General information

```{r}
db_info(file_clinvar)
```

The function `db_info()<-` can be used to update this information.

### Data model

As shown above the data model of an MDB can be retrieved and plot the following
way.

```{r}
plot(data_model(file_clinvar))
```

Tables names can be listed with the `names()` function and changed
with `names()<-` or `rename()`.

```{r}
names(file_clinvar)
```

The different collection members of an MDBs are listed with
the `collection_members()` function and updated with `collection_members()<-`.

```{r}
collection_members(file_clinvar)
```

### Size

The following functions are use to get the number of tables, the number of
fields per table and the number of records.

```{r}
length(file_clinvar)        # Number of tables
lengths(file_clinvar)       # Number of fields per table
count_records(file_clinvar) # Number of records per table
```

The `count_records()` function can take a lot of time when dealing
with *fileMDB* objects if the data files are very large.
In such case it could be more clever to list data file size.

```{r}
data_file_size(file_clinvar, hr=TRUE)
```

<!------------->
## Pulling, subsetting and combining

There are several possible ways to pull data tables from MDBs.
The following lines return the same results.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data_tables(file_clinvar, "ClinVar_traitNames")[[1]]
file_clinvar[["ClinVar_traitNames"]]
file_clinvar$"ClinVar_traitNames"
```

```{r}
file_clinvar %>% pull(ClinVar_traitNames)
```

MDBs can also be subset and combined.
The corresponding functions ensure that the data model is fulfilled by the
data tables.

```{r}
file_clinvar[1:3]
c(file_clinvar[1:3], file_hpo[c(1,5,7)]) %>% 
   data_model() %>% auto_layout(force=TRUE) %>% plot()
```

The function `c()` concatenates the provided MDB after checking that tables
names are not duplicated.
It does not integrate the data with any relational table.
This can achieved by merging the MDBs as described in
the [Merging with collections](#Merging-with-collections) section.

<!------------->
## Filtering and joining

An MDB can be filtered by filtering one or several tables based on
field values. The filtering is propagated to other tables using the
embedded data model.

In the example below, the `file_clinvar` object is filtered in order
to focus on a few genes with pathogenic variants
(the tables have been renamed using the `set_names()` function
to improve the readability of the example).
The object returned by `filter()` or `slice` is a *memoMDB*: all the data
are in memory.

```{r}
filtered_clinvar <- file_clinvar %>% 
   set_names(sub("ClinVar_", "", names(.))) %>%
   filter(
      entrezNames = symbol %in% c("PIK3R2", "UGT1A8")
   ) %>% 
   slice(ReferenceClinVarAssertion=grep(
      "pathogen",
      .$ReferenceClinVarAssertion$clinicalSignificance,
      ignore.case=TRUE
   ))
```

Tables can be easily joined to get diseases associated to the genes of interest.

```{r}
gene_traits <- filtered_clinvar %>% 
   join_mdb_tables(
      "entrezNames", "varEntrez", "variants", "rcvaVariant",
      "ReferenceClinVarAssertion", "rcvaTraits", "traits"
   )
gene_traits$entrezNames %>%
   select(symbol, name, variants.type, variants.name, traitType, traits.name)
```

<!------------->
## Merging with collections

### Collections and collection members

Some databases refer to the same concepts and could be merged accordingly.
However they often use different vocabularies.

For example, CHEMBL refers to biological entities (BE) in
the *CHEMBL_component_sequence* table using mainly
Uniprot peptide identifiers from different species.

```{r}
file_chembl$CHEMBL_component_sequence %>% head()
```

Whereas ClinVar refers to BE in
the *ClinVar_entrezNames* table using human Entrez gene identifiers.

```{r}
file_clinvar$ClinVar_entrezNames %>% head()
```

Some tools exist to convert such BE identifiers from one scope to
the other ([BED][bed], [mygene][mygene], [biomaRt][biomart]).
TKCat provides mechanism to document these scopes in order to allow
automatic conversions from and to any of them.
Those concepts are called **Collections** in TKCat and they should be
formally defined before being able to document any of their members.
Two collection definitions are provided within the TKCat package
and other can be imported with the `import_local_collection()` function.

```{r}
list_local_collections()
```

The way to describe the scope of a collection member is formally defined
by a JSON schema (use `get_local_collection()` to get the JSON of a collection).
Here are the definition of the BE collection members provided by
the *CHEMBL_component_sequence* and the *ClinVar_entrezNames* tables.

```{r}
collection_members(file_chembl, "BE")
collection_members(file_clinvar, "BE")
```

The *Collection* column indicates the collection to which the table refers.
The *cid* column indicates the version of the collection definition which
should correspond to the `$id` of JSON schema. The *resource* column indicated
the name of the resource and the *mid* column an identifier which is unique
for each member of a collection in each resource. The *field* column indicated
each part of the scope of collection. In the case of BE, 4 fields should be
documented:

- be: the type of BE (e.g. Gene or Peptide)
- source: the source of the identifier (e.g. EntrezGene or Peptide)
- organism: the organism to which the identifier refers (e.g Homo sapiens)
- identifier: the identifier itself.

Each of these fields can be *static* or not. `TRUE` means that the value of
this field is the same for all the records and is provided in the *value*
column. Whereas `FALSE` means that the value can be different for each
record and is provided in the column the name of which is given in the *value*
column. The *type* column is only used for the organism field in the case
of the BE collection and can take 2 values: "Scientific name"
or "NCBI taxon identifier".
The definition of the pre-build BE collection members follows the terminology
used in the [BED][bed] package [@godard_bed:_2018].
But it can be adapted according to the solution chosen for converting
BE identifiers from one scope to another.

Setting up the definition of such scope is done using
the `collection_members<-()` function
as shown in the [Reading HPO example](#hpo) above.

### Shared collections and merging

The aim of collections is to identify potential bridges between MDBs.
The `get_shared_collection()` function is used to list all the collections
shared by two MDBs.

```{r}
get_shared_collections(filtered_clinvar, file_chembl)
```

In this example, there are 3 different ways to merge the
two MDBs *filtered_clinvar* and *file_chembl*:

- Based on conditions provided respectively in the *traits* and
in the *CHEMBL_drug_indication* tables
- Based on conditions provided respectively in the *traitsCref* and
in the *CHEMBL_drug_indication* tables
- Based on BE provided respectively in the *entrezNames* and
in the *CHEMBL_component_sequence* tables

The code below shows how to merge these two resources based on BE information.
To achieve this task it relies on a function provided with TKCat along with
BE collection definition
(to get the function: `get_collection_mapper("BE")`). This function uses
the BED package and you need this package to be installed with a connection
to BED database in order to run the code below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sel_coll <- get_shared_collections(file_clinvar, file_chembl) %>% 
   filter(collection=="BE")
filtered_cv_chembl <- merge(
   x=file_clinvar,
   y=file_chembl,
   by=sel_coll
)
```

The returned object is **metaMDB** gathering the original MDBs and a
relational table between members of the same collection as defined
by the `by` parameter.

Additional information about collection can be found [here][[collections].

### Merging without collection

If the *Collection* column of the `by` parameter
is `NA`, then the relational table is built by merging identical columns in
table.x and table.y (No conversion occurs).
For example, *file_hpo* and *file_clinvar* MDBs could be merged according
to conditions provided in the *HPO_diseases* and the *ClinVar_traitCref* tables
respectively.

```{r}
get_shared_collections(file_hpo, file_clinvar)
```

These conditions could be converted using a function provided
with TKCat (`get_collection_mapper("Condition")`) and
which rely on the DODO package.
The two tables can also be simply concatenated without applying any conversion
(loosing the advantage of such conversion obviously).

```{r}
sel_coll <- get_shared_collections(file_hpo, file_clinvar) %>% 
   filter(table.x=="HPO_diseases", table.y=="ClinVar_traitCref") %>% 
   mutate(collection=NA)
sel_coll
hpo_clinvar <- merge(file_hpo, file_clinvar, by=sel_coll)
plot(data_model(hpo_clinvar))
hpo_clinvar$HPO_diseases_ClinVar_traitCref %>% head()
```

# MDB catalogs as TKCat objects

<!------------->
## Local TKCat

MDB can be gathered in a *TKCat* (Tailored Knowledge Catalog) object.

```{r}
k <- TKCat(file_hpo, file_clinvar)
```

Gathering MDBs in such a catalog facilitate their exploration and their
preparation for potential integration. Several functions are available
to achieve this goal.

```{r}
list_MDBs(k)                     # list all the MDBs in a TKCat object
get_MDB(k, "HPO")                # get a specific MDBs from the catalog
search_MDB_tables(k, "disease")  # Search table about "disease"
search_MDB_fields(k, "disease")  # Search a field about "disease"
collection_members(k)            # Get collection members of the different MDBs
c(k, TKCat(file_chembl))         # Merge 2 TKCat objects
```

<!------------->
## chTKCat

A *chTKCat* object is a catalog of MDB as a *TKCat* object described above
but relying on a [ClickHouse][clickhouse] database.
Therefore it requires the installation and the initialization of such a
database. Two additional vignettes describes:

- [How to install and administrate a chTKCat database][opman]
- [How to connect to an existing chTKCat database and use it][chuguide]

<!------------->
## A shiny app for exploring MDBs

The function `explore_MDBs(k)` launches a shiny interface to explore
MDBs in a *TKCat* or a *chTKCat* object.
This exploration interface can be easily deployed using an *app.R* file
with content similar to the one below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(TKCat)
explore_MDBs(k, download=TRUE)
```

![](explore_MDBs-local.png){width=100%}

In this interface the users can explore the resources available in the catalog.
They can browse the data model of each of them with some sample data.
They can also search for information provided in resources, tables or fields.
Finally, if the parameter `download` is set to `TRUE`, the users will also
be able to download the data: either each table individually or
an archive of the whole MDB.
